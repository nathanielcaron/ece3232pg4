### Project built to run on a dsPIC33CK256MP506 microcontroller (16-bit compiler).

This Project consists of using an HC-SR04 proximity sensor to detect the movements of a user's hand to control which music note to play on a speaker. 
Other inputs and outputs include octave selection buttons, a volume dial, a seven-segment display to visualise the note played and an LED to indicate a sharp note.

The project is meant to be a teaching device for beginners and can double as an instrument.
